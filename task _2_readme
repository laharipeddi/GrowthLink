# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on anonymized and transformed features. It uses classification techniques to distinguish
between legitimate and fraudulent transactions with high accuracy

Project Objective

- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using anonymized PCA-transformed features (`V1`–`V28`), along with `Amount` and `Time`.
- Handle class imbalance (very few fraud cases).
- Perform feature selection based on correlation with the target (`Class`).
- Train and evaluate multiple ML models using selected features.
