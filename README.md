#  Iris Species Classification - Machine Learning Project

This is a simple machine learning project that uses the classic Iris dataset to classify flower species based on four key features. The model is built in Python using scikit-learn and is currently implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) format within VS Code.

## Project Objective

- Classify **Iris-setosa**, **Iris-versicolor**, and **Iris-virginica** using features:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, feature selection, preprocessing, and train different models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, etc.)
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and visualization (confusion matrix, pairplots, histograms, etc.)
